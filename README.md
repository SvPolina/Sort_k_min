# Sort_k_min
  The program finds the K smallest elements up to given checkpoint in an array of length n.
  1.The program receives the size of integer array - n, which is randomaly initialized and k - the number of the smallest elements we would like to find. 
  2.The three checkpoints are n1=n/4, n2=n/2 and n3=3n/4.
  3.The program displays the K smallest elements up to checkpoints n1, n2 and n3.
    The implementation is based on a red-black tree with all the necessary functions implemented following the "Introduction to       Algorithms" T.H.Cormen.
